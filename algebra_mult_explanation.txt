Multiplying 12 by 3.14 involves a straightforward calculation. I'll guide you through the steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - You have two numbers, 12 (which can represent 12 units of something) and 3.14 (which could be a numerical constant like π approximated to two decimal places).
   - You need to multiply these two numbers.

2. **Set Up the Calculation:**
   \[
12 \times 3.14
\]

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - We multiply 12 by 3.14:

   Step-by-step calculation:
   \[
12 \times 3.14 = (12 \times 3) + (12 \times 0.14)
   \]

   \[
12 \times 3 = 36
   \]

   \[
12 \times 0.14 = 1.68
   \]

4. **Add the Results:**
   \[
36 + 1.68 = 37.68
   \]

So, \( 12 \times 3.14 = 37.68 \).
